A MEVN stack application to help anyone manage their own little library online - manage inventory, members, loans.

## Getting started

### Node / JS

> **Note:**
>
> - _There is an **index.js** file located under the \*\*\_src_\*\* folder\_

- with **_node_**, copy and enter one of the following commands on your terminal:

  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

  or:
